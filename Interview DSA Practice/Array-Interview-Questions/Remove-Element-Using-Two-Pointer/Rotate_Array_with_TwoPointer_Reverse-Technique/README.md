# 🔁 Array Rotation CLI Utility

A Node.js-based command-line tool that rotates arrays to the right by `k` steps. It supports two efficient algorithms: **Cyclic Replacement** (in-place) and **Reversal Method** (in-place), and optionally a simpler **Extra Space** method.

## 🚀 Features

- Interactive CLI input for array size, rotation steps, and values
- Supports multiple rotation algorithms:
  - ✅ Cyclic Replacement (O(1) space)
  - ✅ Reversal Algorithm (O(1) space)
  - ✅ Extra Space Method (O(n) space)
- In-place mutation with clear output
- Robust input validation
- Easy to extend with flags or modes
